# Game-Spacewar
one of the first video games ever is remade 

Open Level.unity file in Assets folder to test out the game. 

The player is the green ship. Use four arrow keys to navigate the ship. Try shooting red ships enemies by firing missiles with the spacebar and score points. Player can also score points by staying inside the green zone, but watch out for the yellow stars that suck ships in with their gravity. The player ship can wrap around the screen, while the enemy ship can't.
